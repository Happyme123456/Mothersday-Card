    <p>I am so thankful to have you as a mom because you support me through most of my choices unless they aren't smart then I learn that they aren't smart that way. You are nice to me and aren't mean to me even when I am a pain to you. I wouldn't ever ask for a new mom even when I am mad. You are the ONLY mom I want. I know I can be a pain to you sometimes but sometimes its not intentional but you still deal with me and my attitude. Love you mom-JJ </p>
